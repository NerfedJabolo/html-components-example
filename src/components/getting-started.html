          HTML Components is a lightweight and versatile JavaScript solution for

            The guide expects you to have a basic understanding of HTML. The
            guide will assume that you are familiar with HTML tags, attributes,
            and syntax. If you are not familiar with HTML, you can learn it from
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" class="text-green-500"

            where we will make the components. Note that this setup is not
            mandatory and you can name the files and folders as you like.
